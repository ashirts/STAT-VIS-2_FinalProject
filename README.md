    # STAT VIS II Final Project

This repository contains the materials for our project **"Examining the Effects of Climate Change Across the Globe"**.  
We explore global trends in temperature change, sea level rise, climate-related disasters, and deforestation using real-world datasets and a variety of data visualization techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **`code`**  
  Contains all R scripts and code used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

- **`graphics`**  
  Contains all final figures and plots generated for the project report and presentation.

- **`data`**  
  Contains the raw datasets used for analysis.
  
- **`presentation`**  
Contains all the files that were used for the presentation, including the .tex and .pdf files. 
## About the Project

In this project, we analyzed four major indicators of climate change:
- Global surface temperature changes (1961–2022)
- Sea level changes (1992–2025)
- Frequency and type of climate-related disasters (1988–2022)
- Forest coverage and carbon stock changes (1992–2022)

We performed extensive data cleaning, interpolation, aggregation, and visualization to better understand the multifaceted impacts of climate change over time and across regions.

## Technologies Used

The analysis was conducted using **R** \cite{R-base} and several R packages, including but not limited to:
- `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `forcats`
- `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `gganimate`, `gifski`
- `countrycode`, `rnaturalearth`, `rnaturalearthdata`
- `sf`, `zoo`, `psych`
- `RColorBrewer`, `gridExtra`, `tidyplots`
